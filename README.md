# Quote Machine

The Quote Machine project is a simple web application that generates random quotes and allows users to share them on social media platforms such as Twitter and Telegram. It provides a visually appealing user interface with smooth animations and dynamic color changes.

## Features

- Random Quote Generation: The application randomly selects a quote from a predefined list of quotes each time the "New Quote" button is clicked.
- Smooth Text Transition: When a new quote is generated, the text smoothly fades out, updates with the new quote, and fades back in, providing a visually pleasing transition.
- Dynamic Color Changes: The background color, button colors, and text colors change dynamically with each new quote, creating a vibrant and engaging user experience.
- Twitter Sharing: Users can share the current quote on Twitter by clicking the "Tweet" button. The tweet text is automatically populated with the selected quote and author.
- Telegram Sharing: Users can share the current quote on Telegram by clicking the Telegram icon. The quote and author are included in the shared message.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: The project is built using these core web technologies to structure the page, apply styles, and add interactivity.
- jQuery: The jQuery library is utilized for DOM manipulation, event handling, and animation effects, providing a concise and convenient way to interact with the web page elements.
- Google Fonts: The "Dancing Script" font from Google Fonts is used to give the quotes a visually appealing and elegant appearance.
- Font Awesome: The Font Awesome library provides a collection of scalable vector icons, including the Twitter and Telegram icons used for sharing functionality.
